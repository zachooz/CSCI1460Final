In just 50 years, 2 billion to 3.5 billion people, mostly the poor who can't afford air conditioning, will be living in a climate that historically has been too hot to handle, a new study said. With every 1.8 degree (1 degree Celsius) increase in global average annual temperature from man-made climate change, about a billion or so people will end up in areas too warm day-in, day-out to be habitable without cooling technology, according to ecologist Marten Scheffer of Wageningen University in the Netherlands, co-author of the study. Under the worst-case scenarios for population growth and for carbon pollution, which many climate scientists say is looking less likely these days, the study in Monday's journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences predicts about 3.5 billion people will live in extremely hot areas.

Long before the Asian giant hornet began terrorizing the honeybees of Washington State, the ferocious insects posed a sometimes lethal threat to hikers and farmers in the mountains of rural Japan. But in the central Chubu region, these insects -- sometimes called "murder hornets" -- are known for more than their aggression and excruciating sting.  The adults, which can be two inches long, are fried on skewers, stinger and all, until the carapace becomes light and crunchy.  Upon finding the nest, the hunters stun the insects with smoke, then use chain saws and shovels to extract it. Torao Suzuki, 75, said he removed 40 to 50 nests a year, getting stung as many as 30 times each season. "Even when I tell people, they're going to sting you, they still eat them. They say it makes them potent," he said. Lacquered brown hives, sometimes cut open to expose their complex lattice work, adorn vestibules and reception rooms in homes, schools and public offices. Historians say the insects, which range throughout Asia but are found most commonly in Japan, were once valued along with other wasps as a cheap source of protein in poverty-stricken rural areas. The cuisine is celebrated each November in Gifu Prefecture at a festival, known as the Kushihara Hebo Matsuri, where prizes are handed out for the largest nests, and gourmands bid for the privilege of taking one home with them. A flyer for the 2018 event warned participants to be on the lookout for hornets on the loose near the fairgrounds, advising attendees to "please take ample care to avoid being stung." Shota Toguchida, who owns a Chinese restaurant in the city, said he sold shots of homemade hornet liquor for 2,000 yen, or about $19, mostly to middle-aged men.

## Trump’s anti-China rhetoric aimed at boosting US leverage

The Trump administration is making ever louder pronouncements casting blame on China for the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to sidestep domestic criticism of the president's own response, tarnish China's global reputation and give the U.S. leverage on trade and other aspects of U.S.-China competition. President Donald Trump has vowed to penalize China for what U.S. officials have increasingly described as a pattern of deceit that denied the world precious time to prepare for the pandemic. The opening salvo isn't in the form of tariffs or sanctions, but in a one-sided accounting of China's behavior that could yank the Chinese lower on the global reputation meter. The State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House have all launched public efforts in recent days to lay bare what they say is clear evidence that China tried to mask the scale of the outbreak and then refused to provide critical access to U.S. and global scientists that could have saved lives. The Trump administration, a senior administration official says, is trying to convince the world that China isn't playing by the same rules as everyone else, and that may be the biggest punishment for an intensely proud emerging superpower.

## Gridlock gone, sports car collectors take over Times Square

Danny Lin cruised his white sports car down Broadway, the bright lights of Times Square gleaming off his sharply detailed Audi R8. He looped through the tourist hotspot again and again, navigating around Corvettes, Mercedes, Mustangs and BMWs -- a parade of high-priced vehicles gathered for a rare photo-op. "I never bring my car here," said the 24-year-old from Queens. "Only for today, to get some cool shots." From a star turn in "Taxi Driver" to the Naked Cowboy to the million people who crowd its streets on New Year's Eve, the "Crossroads of the World" has for generations been an iconic New York backdrop in movies, culture and the arts. Now, Times Square has taken a turn toward Tokyo Drift, just without the "Fast and the Furious," as car-loving New Yorkers flock to the barren streets of the theater district. Car mavens normally wouldn't dare rev their engines in gridlocked Midtown, but they're eagerly driving into Manhattan to take photos and show off for sparse crowds walking through the famed streets. At least 100 pedestrians were wandering the area when the cars began roaring down Times Square's main drag Saturday, along with dozens of motorcycles in one crew that created a deafening buzz. Mike Hodurski and Steve Cruz brought their Chevrolet pickup trucks Wednesday night and took photos in front of a light-up American flag at the corner of Broadway and 43rd Street. Andre Godfrey has driven his 2018 Ford Mustang -- with glowing red shark teeth embedded in the grill -- into Times Square twice.advantage of it now, while nobody's over here," Hodurski said. "The streets are dead. You'd never get to see the streets like this. So we said, 'You know what, screw it,' and we all got together."
